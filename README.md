# Sophisticated Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This is a Python-based password strength checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on various factors such as length, character variety, and common patterns. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, where users can input their password and receive immediate feedback on its strength.

The password strength is assessed based on:
- **Entropy**: The complexity of the password, calculated using a logarithmic formula.
- **Length**: Passwords shorter than 8 characters are considered weak.
- **Common Password Check**: Checks if the password matches known weak passwords (hashed with SHA-256).
- **Patterns**: Detects common patterns such as repeated characters and sequential patterns like "123", "qwerty", etc.

## Features
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the complexity of the password.
- **Pattern Detection**: Warns against common patterns and repeated characters.
- **Common Password Check**: Flags passwords that are too common based on SHA-256 hash comparison.
- **Real-time Feedback**: As you type, the password strength is evaluated and displayed in the GUI.
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: Strength feedback is color-coded for clarity:
  - Red: Weak
  - Orange: Moderate
  - Green: Strong or Very Strong
